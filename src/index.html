        <h1>Hi, my name is Julius. I am a Berlin based designer and developer, creating digital products for humans. I love building things from first draft to final release.</h1>
        <div class="detail-text">
            <p>I am currently studying communication design at HTW Berlin and working for <a href="http://goodpatch.com">Goodpatch</a> â€“ a Tokyo and Berlin based product design studio.</p>
            <p>In the past years I have been self employed, co-founded a digital design agency and a social photo book start-up. Then and now I mostly create Websites, mobile Apps and corporate designs, while being in charge of the whole creation process.</p>
            <p>I am thrilled about crafting awesome things out of nothing, combining my skills in UX, UI and brand design as well as frontend and backend development.</p>
